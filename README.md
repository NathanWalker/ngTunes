# ngTunes

ngTunes is a music visualization application written using angular 2. 
Users can search Spotify for tracks to customize a playlist to sample 
their favorite tunes. While listening and viewing their playlist users 
can also tweet about what they're rocking as well as set what others 
are enjoying.

A mashup of many technologies was used to bring this experience to users. 
The project was scaffolded up using the angular CLI and utilized to build 
the application. The visualization engine is a port of audiograph which 
was brought in as it's own angular 2 component. The music catalog takes 
advantage of Spotify's API for searching and track playback. Twitter's 
API was used for both the ability to retrieve related tweets via live 
stream and for posting to the user's timeline if they choose to share. 
(Add screenshot info if we get that working too)
